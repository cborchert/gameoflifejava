# The game of life ðŸ‘½

## Running

Rather than running from intellij or whatever IDE you have, you'd probably get a better experience running from the terminal directly.

From the project's `/out/production/gameOfLife` directory, run:

```bash
java com/cborchert/gameOfLife/Main
```

and enjoy the show.
